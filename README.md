# DolphinGameSettingsGenerator

### Dolphin Game Settings Generator
* A tool to generate individual game settings for the GameCube/Wii emulator
    * Link to Dolphin: https://dolphin-emu.org/

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have Dolphin installed
* Open the tool (you'll need the latest JDK installed for that)
    * Link to JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
* Press Pick Game for INI and then the tool will let you search for a game
* Press Pick Game Settings for INI and pick your options
* Once you're done, then press Generate Game Settings INI to save your new settings file
* Move that newly created file into your Dolphin install folder's GameSettings folder
* Enjoy having a convenient way to change individual game settings!

### Notes about this tool
* This tool was built with the latest development version of Dolphin in mind
* Dolphin does already have this feature to some extent
  * In my opinion, it's very limited and is a lot of manual text editing
